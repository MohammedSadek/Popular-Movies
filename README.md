# Popular-Movies
In this project, I will build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. I will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.
Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

In this stage I’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:
--------------
1-Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2-Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
 2.1-The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
3-Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information 
such as:
 3.1-original title
 3.2movie poster image thumbnail
 3.3-A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
 3.4-user rating (called vote_average in the api)
 3.5-release date
